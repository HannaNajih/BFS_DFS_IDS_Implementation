# Graph Search Algorithms: BFS, DFS, and IDS

This project implements three fundamental graph search algorithms‚Äî**Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, and **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)**‚Äîon various types of graphs. The project also compares the performance of these algorithms using two graph representations: **Adjacency Matrix** and **Adjacency List**.

---

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
3. **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)**

---

## Graph Types

The algorithms are tested on four types of graphs:

1. **Sparse Directed Graph**
2. **Dense Directed Graph**
3. **Sparse Undirected Graph**
4. **Dense Undirected Graph**

---

## Graph Representations

1. **Adjacency Matrix**
2. **Adjacency List**

---

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher** installed on your system.
- A terminal or command prompt to run the program.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name

   Output
The program will output:

The visited nodes for each algorithm.

The execution time for each algorithm.

**Performance Comparison**
The project includes a comparison of the performance of the algorithms using both Adjacency Matrix and Adjacency List representations. The results are presented in a tabular format, highlighting the differences in execution time for sparse and dense graphs.
